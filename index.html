<h1>What are diatoms?</h1>

<p id="para1">Diatoms (class Bacillariophyceae) are unicellular microalgae with well-preserved silica cell walls, widely distributed and abundant in both fresh and marine water, and even moist terrestrial environments that have sufficient light for photosynthesis (Moser, 2004). They are another ancient group, of which earliest known fossils are dated back to the Late Jurassic (Girard et al., 2020). The diatom assemblages can be indications of numerous environmental variables such as pH, salinity, eutrophication, water level, turbulence etc. and have been commonly used to examine past limnological conditions and climatic changes (Battarbee et al., 2001). </p1>

<p id="para2">Diatoms are characterized by their unique silica cell walls called frustules which are made up of two overlapping halves called thecae. Each theca consists of a valve held together by a fragile band (girdle). Nearly all diatoms have fine pores (areolae) on the cell walls – these simple perforations can appear as continuous lines (striae), forming distinct pattern for each species (Battarbee et al., 2001). Based on the shape of the frustules (Figure 2.2; Figure 2.3), there are two main groups of diatoms: centric diatoms – characterized by radial symmetry, and pennate diatoms – characterized by bilateral symmetry (Almqvist et al., 2001). Most pennate diatoms possess an elongated slit, or a pair of fissures in the valve called the raphe. Its type (e.g. naviculoid or canal), presence or absence help further categorize pennate diatoms into smaller groups (Battarbee et al., 2001). Since the silica walls do not undergo decomposition, they are well preserved in the sediment.  The shape, size and ornamentation of the valves are crucial for an exact identification down to species level (Battarbee et al., 2001; Jalba et al., 2005).</p>

<p id="para3">Diatoms are widely distributed worldwide in both freshwater and marine environments, with an estimation of about 100,000 extant species (Mann & Vanormelingen, 2013). They contribute approximately 20% of the Earth’s total primary production, including 40% of the total marine primary production and play an important role in the biological carbon pump (Tréguer et al., 2018). There can be found both very tolerant species with a wide range of ecological tolerance, and very tenacious species with narrow and distinct environmental requirements. Their short lifespans and rapid reproduction help them respond quickly to environmental changes, especially those driven by intense anthropogenic landscape modification and post-industrial climate warming (Battarbee et al., 2001). Overall, their abundance, diversity in ecological niches and quick response rate make diatoms an excellent proxy to reconstruct past limnological and climatic changes.</p>
