<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;">What are diatoms?<h1>
<p>Diatoms (class Bacillariophyceae) are unicellular microalgae with well-preserved silica cell walls, widely distributed and abundant in both fresh and marine water, and even moist terrestrial environments that have sufficient light for photosynthesis (Moser, 2004). They are another ancient group, of which earliest known fossils are dated back to the Late Jurassic (Girard et al., 2020). The diatom assemblages can be indications of numerous environmental variables such as pH, salinity, eutrophication, water level, turbulence etc. and have been commonly used to examine past limnological conditions and climatic changes (Battarbee et al., 2001). <p>
