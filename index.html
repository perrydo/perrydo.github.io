<h1>What are diatoms?</h1>
<!-- My MSc thesis is focused on diatom so I thought why not making it the main topic of the website? After all, I've already had all the materials needed instead of having to come up with a new topic and find new materials -->
<p>Diatoms (class Bacillariophyceae) are unicellular microalgae with well-preserved silica cell walls, widely distributed and abundant in both fresh and marine water, and even moist terrestrial environments that have sufficient light for photosynthesis (Moser, 2004). They are another ancient group, of which earliest known fossils are dated back to the Late Jurassic (Girard et al., 2020). The diatom assemblages can be indications of numerous environmental variables such as pH, salinity, eutrophication, water level, turbulence etc. and have been commonly used to examine past limnological conditions and climatic changes (Battarbee et al., 2001). </p>

<p>Diatoms are widely distributed worldwide in both freshwater and marine environments, with an estimation of about 100,000 extant species (Mann & Vanormelingen, 2013). They contribute approximately 20% of the Earth’s total primary production, including 40% of the total marine primary production and play an important role in the biological carbon pump (Tréguer et al., 2018). There can be found both very tolerant species with a wide range of ecological tolerance, and very tenacious species with narrow and distinct environmental requirements. Their short lifespans and rapid reproduction help them respond quickly to environmental changes, especially those driven by intense anthropogenic landscape modification and post-industrial climate warming (Battarbee et al., 2001). Overall, their abundance, diversity in ecological niches and quick response rate make diatoms an excellent proxy to reconstruct past limnological and climatic changes.</p>

<h1>Diatom habitats</h1>

<p>In lakes, diatoms can be found colonizing both benthic and planktonic habitats. The plankton can spend a part of (meroplankton), or their entire life cycle suspended in the water column. On the other hand, the benthos are associated with substrates such as mud (epipelic), stones (epilithic) and aquatic plants (epiphytic) around the margins of lakes. Notably, some taxa are benthic, but can also be found in planktonic habitat under certain conditions (tychoplankton or pseudoplankton) (Battarbee et al., 2001). Most diatoms are solitary; however, many taxa can form colonies that vary in shape and size. Some taxa such as <i>Aulacoisera</i> and <i>Fragilaria</i> can form chain colonies linked together by spines, while other taxa such as <i>Tabellaria</i> can form star-shaped, zigzag or coiled colonies linked together by muco-polysaccharide strands or pads (Battarbee et al., 2001).</p>

<!-- A picture is worth a thousand words, and it's much easier to show what a colony of diatoms might look like than trying to describe it -->
