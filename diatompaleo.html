<h1>What is paleolimnology?</h1>

<p>There are many techniques that are employed to reconstruct paleoclimate such as studies of ice core, tree rings, coral remains, speleothems among others (DeLong et al., 2013; Verheyden et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009), but paleolimnology remains one of the most popular methods. Paleolimnology is a multidisciplinary science that uses various physical, chemical, and biological information preserved in lake sediments to interpret and reconstruct the past climates, limnological processes and conditions in lake basins. These proxies can come from both autochthonous (internal) and allochthonous (external) sources, such as catchment, groundwater and the atmosphere (Last & Smol, 2001). By analyzing these indicators, it is possible to reconstruct not only the past aquatic conditions, but also the past terrestrial conditions in the watershed. </p>

<h1>How diatoms are used in paleolimnology</h1>

<p>The benthic-planktonic ratio can be used to infer past water depths. Specifically, a decline in lake level will result in a relative increase in benthic taxa as well as a decrease in planktonic diatoms, suggesting a shallower lake and vice versa (Haig et al., 2013; Laird et al., 2011). Changes in diatom assemblages can also help detecting an increase in LWST associated with climate warming. In subarctic and temperate lakes, small, planktonic cyclotelloid diatoms becoming dominant over heavier, tychoplanktonic diatoms that rely on strong turbulence in water columns to stay in the photic zone is a signal that the lake is becoming more stratified. Whilst in High Arctic lakes, diatom assemblages can shift from predominantly benthic fragilarioid species (family Fragilariaceae) to a more complex and diverse assemblages of periphytic diatom as a respond to habitat expansion and longer growing season resulting from decreasing ice cover (Rühland et al., 2015).</p>

<p>As many diatom taxa show clear preferences on pH, trophic status and salinity, diatoms have long been used as sensitive indicators of those environmental variables (Van Dam et al., 1994). Diatoms have been used as eutrophication indicators since the beginning of the 20th century, however, they only became a primary tool starting from the 1970s (Battarbee et al., 2001). During the 1980s, as concerns about acid rain became publicly widespread, diatoms have also been used to reconstruct surface water acidification in lakes across Europe and North America (Schindler, 1988). And in recent years, as salinity increase caused by de-icing road salts becoming a growing threat to freshwater lakes, halophilic diatom taxa have been proven to be invaluable in tracking salinity/conductivity (Ginn et al., 2015; Oškinis & Kasperovičius, 2005).</p>

<p>Pollen and diatoms are indictive of different environmental variables and often used together as complementary proxy indicators in paleolimnological research. A multiproxy pollen and diatoms dataset can present robust arguments about the impacts of past climate changes and human impacts on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Studying the connections between terrestrial and aquatic responses to climatic changes will provide significant insight into how the biosphere responds to climatic changes, as well as the relationship between different ecosystems (Finkelstein et al., 2005). </p>
